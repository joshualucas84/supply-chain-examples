## Admission Controller and key validation

* Generate your own keys, and replace the public keys in admission-control-verify-image.yaml for gcr.io and ttl.sh

## Run build

For the sake of simplicity run `update_and_run.sh`. This makes it easy to apply any changes you might make to the pipeline for testing.
